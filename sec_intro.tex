Overview:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Reason about a sequence of relaxations, as opposed to a single benchmark
\item Relaxations are random variables, not fixed values
\item They depend on revealing some information
\item Adversary is weakened in two ways: less information and has to process in the same order as online.
\item Study the sequence of relaxations with relaxed bellman equations
\item Predict the maximizers in the relaxed bellman eqs using an estimator of the relaxation
\end{enumerate}
